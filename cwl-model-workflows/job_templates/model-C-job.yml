#Please replace all instances of <inp> with the desired input.

#Provide the number of CPU threads the workflow is allowed to use as an integer (e.g. 8).

#Provide the (relative or absolute) path to a file containing basecalled nanopore reads.
reads:
  class: File
  path: <inp>

#Provide a base pair size estimate for the genome you are trying to assemble as an integer (e.g. 3000000).
estimated_genome_size: <inp>

#Provide a string identifying the basecalling model that was used to basecall the reads.
#Available models: r941_trans, r941_flip213, r941_flip235, r941_min_fast, r941_min_high, r941_prom_fast, r941_prom_high
#For basecalling with guppy version >= v3.0.3, select model based on pore name and whether high or fast basecalling was used.
#For flip flop basecalling with v3.03 > guppy version => v2.3.5 select r941_flip235.
#For flip flop basecalling with v2.3.5 > guppy version >= 2.1.3 select r941_flip213.
#For transducer basecaling using Albacore or non-flip-flop guppy basecalling, select r941_trans.
